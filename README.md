# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-News-Sentiment-
This project combines historical stock data with real-time news sentiment to predict future stock prices using Python. It demonstrates how financial markets can be influenced by public sentiment and how machine learning models can integrate this data for more informed forecasting.

ðŸ”§ Features:
   Fetch historical stock data using yfinance
   Scrape or import financial news headlines
   Perform sentiment analysis using VADER or TextBlob
   Combine sentiment scores with stock price indicators
   Train ML models (Linear Regression, LSTM, etc.) to predict stock price trends
   Visualize sentiment and price trends with matplotlib and seaborn
  ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used:
      Python, Pandas, NumPy
      yfinance, NLTK (VADER), TextBlob
      scikit-learn, Keras/TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
      Matplotlib, Seaborn
 ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation:
   RMSE, MAE for regression tasks
   Accuracy, Precision, Recall for classification-based trend prediction

  ðŸ“Œ Future Work:
    Use transformer-based models like BERT for advanced sentiment analysis
    Deploy model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
